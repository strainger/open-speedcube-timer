# offline-speedcube-timer

## What and Why?

Offline Speedcube Timer (ost) is an offline, crossplatform, speed cube timer. Whether you are timing a full solve or parts of a solve you can categorize and store your times for personal tracking and analytics.

Most speedcube timers require an internet connection which some struggle to have at all times. This project is meant to fill that need while being completely free to everyone.

## What does ost do?

ost can..

- start timing once space is released after being held for 1 second or more
- stop timing (if already timing) if any key is pressed on a keyboard

## What will ost do soon?

ost will..

- show a wca compliant scramble (if enabled)
- work on Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems
- give you the ability to add/remove custom categories for time logging (such as "F2L only", "Roux First Block", "OLL", etc)
- log data to a folder based on the category (one file per category) (A single file could be used but for keeping things clean I believe this would be the best option)
- give you an interface to preview statistics of your solves based on your categories (or multiple categories (CFOP or ZZ or ROUX full solves alone or all data combined))
- look fantastic
